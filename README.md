# HackAssemblerEditor
GUI Editor for the Hack assembly language, written in C++ with Qt 5.

This is based on the Hack language from the excellent book [The Elements of Computing Systems](http://www.nand2tetris.org/book.php).

See [Chapter 4: Machine Language](http://www.nand2tetris.org/chapters/chapter%2004.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the Hack Language.
